e.g. login/logout, register, settings page, etc. (remember these are very generic
examples, you must provide ones specific to your project)
iii. DB connectors if they are going to be used here (separate modules/pckgs only do

b. Backend
i. API endpoints(one heading for each) — describe the incoming parameters and
the responses and its function
ii. Features if any
iii. DB connectors if they are going to be used here (separate modules,pckgs only do
not mix it up with server code, import and use). Note : one separate class has to

c. Database
i. Tables and their names and purpose
ii. Schema designs



d. Overview
i. Intro to the design of the project
ii. A diagram representing front end back end and arrows showing how they

iii. Give a general flow of the application through a tree diagram (website
navigation chart) e.g.,
